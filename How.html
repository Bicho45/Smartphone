 <p class="p6"><strong>Assigning that the agency of a group of things are: determining the budget, between them, operating the <span class="n8">phone</span>,
    the operator that you prefer in the end, the capabilities and which you prefer</strong>.</p>

    <ol type="i"class="aa2"><li><h2 class="hh3">Set your budget</h2>
	<img src="How\budget.JPG"class="i2">
    <p class="p7">We can divide the budget that you perform a <strong>smartphone</strong> with into: the commercial category, which starts from 
    phones starting at <span class="o1">100$</span> and ends with phones that start at <span class="o1">300$</span>, then comes the sub-category that you see 
    between <span class="o1">300$-500$</span>, then comes the higher category that brings the highest prices From <span class="o1">500$</span>.</p></li>

    <li><h2 class="hh40">Determine what you will use the phone</h2>
	<img src="How\what.JPG"class="i3">
    <p class="p8">The user's use and purpose of buying the <span class="n8">phone</span> may vary greatly, as there are people who buy the <span class="n8">phone</span> in order to watch 
    movies and series on it, and another may want to buy the <span class="n8">phone</span> to play on it, and another user may want the <span class="n8">phone</span> to take 
    pictures and videos on it and determine your use of the <span class="n8">phone</span> will help you greatly In choosing the right one for you.</p></li>

    <li><h2 class="hhh">OS</h2>
	<img src="How\OS.JPG"class="i4">
    <p class="p9">The <span class="n1">operating system</span> plays a big role in choosing the smart <span class="n8">phone</span> that you may want to buy, as Apple provides an <span class="n1">operating system</span> that
    is very easy to use, and the protection and general security of this <span class="n1">system </span>makes many users prefer it greatly.<br>
    As for if we look at Android phones, we see a great advantage for it, which is its wide variety, so you see all the categories and 
    prices available in the Android <span class="n1">operating system</span>, and the Android system provides the user with a great possibility to modify and add your personal character 
	to the <span class="n1">operating system</span>.<br>
    Windows 10 <span class="n1">operating system</span>, despite not being very popular among users, but it provides a unique feature in this system, which is
    the presence of unified applications, as the application on Windows 10 on the <span class="n8">phone</span> is the same as on the personal computer or any
    other device running the Windows 10 <span class="n1">operating system</span>.</p></li>

    <li><h2 class="hh5">Time of purchase</h2>
	<img src="How\time.JPG"class="i5">
    <p class="p10">Choosing the right <span class="n8">time</span> to buy a new <span class="n8">phone</span> will save you a lot of money, and you may also be able to get good deals for used phones 
    if you choose the right <span class="n8">time</span>. So we see that the best <span class="n8">time</span> to buy a new <strong>smartphone</strong> is April, as we see that previous generations of
    phones reduce their price. Automatically in order to give <span class="n4">space</span> for the new generation of phones and to be able to compete.</p></li>
 
     <li><h2 class="hh6">Other factors help you choose a <strong>smartphone</strong></h2></li><ol class="aa3">
    <img src="How\other.JPG"class="i6">
	 <li><h3> <span class="hh7">Processor</span> and <span class="hh70">RAM</span>:</h3>
     <img src="How\processor.JPG"class="i60">
	 <img src="How\ram.JPG"class="i7">
     <p class="p11">The <span class="n2">processor</span> is the core of the device on which the general performance depends, and in some cases, the <span class="n2">processor</span> capacity is what
	 limits the updates of the <span class="n1">operating system</span>, and in general, the new Qualcomm processors and Mediatek processors are suitable options.<br>
     At the same <span class="n8">time</span>; Huawei has proven with its Kirin <span class="n2">processor</span> that it can deliver good performance to users. It should also be noted that in order 
	 for any <span class="n2">processor</span> to provide better performance, <span class="n3">RAM</span> capacity is critical. The <span class="n2">processor</span> is important, but we need to look at the <strong>smartphone</strong> and 
	 its technical specifications as a whole.</p></li>
	 
	 <li><h3 class="hh8">Internal storage space:</h3>
	  <img src="How\storage.JPG"class="i8">
	 <p class="p12">When you choose a new Android <span class="n8">phone</span>, check the <span class="n3">RAM</span> capacity and <span class="n4">internal storage space</span>, and not content with what is written on the
	 <span class="n8">phone</span> box. You should have a look at how much <span class="n4">space</span> the previously installed apps are taking up on the <span class="n8">phone</span>.<br>
	 At the same <span class="n8">time</span>, before choosing a model with <span class="n4">internal storage</span> of 128 or 256 GB, think about how much you will actually use it. Do you use your 
	 <strong>smartphone</strong>to save movies, music, files and large applications? If the answer is no, the <span class="n3">64GB storage</span> capacity is most likely for you.<br>
	 Not to mention, you can take advantage of cloud services to save some <span class="n4">space</span> while keeping your files always, provided you have an internet connection. As a 
	 general rule, given the smartphones on the market, it is advised to choose at least <span class="n3">4 GB</span> of <span class="n3">RAM</span>, and <span class="n3">64 GB</span> of <span class="n4">internal memory</span>.</p></li>
	 
	 <li><h3 class="hh9">Battery life:</h3>
	  <img src="How\battery.JPG"class="i9">
	 <p class="p13"><span class="n5">Battery life</span> is one of the most important features to consider when choosing a new <strong>smartphone</strong>. And again don't be fooled by the <span class="n5">battery</span> capacity;
	 Because on its own it does not mean longer <span class="n5">battery life</span>, there are a lot of factors that play a different role and are worth knowing about.
     For example, you should keep in mind that higher resolution screens consume more energy, while the latest processors improve <span class="n5">battery</span> life. There is also a screen
     refresh rate that affects the <span class="n5">battery life</span>, and does the <span class="n8">phone</span> support fast charging technology or not? At the moment 4000 mAh appears to be a suitable option in most
     cases.</p></li>
	 
	 <li><h3 class="hh10">Camera Quality:</h3>
	  <img src="How\camera.JPG"class="i10">
	 <p class="p14"><strong>Smartphone</strong> manufacturers have started paying more attention to <span class="n6">camera quality</span> and related features recently, which is great for users.
	 With multiple lenses, increased resolution, support for auto focus, optical stabilization, manual modes, and special effects,<strong>smartphones</strong> have become
	 more like a digital <span class="n6">camera</span>.<br>
     But keep in mind that it doesn't all depend on the resolution of the <span class="n6">camera</span> lens, <span class="n6">48MP</span> is better than <span class="n6">10MP</span>, but it is important to get an idea of ​​the <span class="n7">type</span> of built-in sensor,
	 the <span class="n6">quality</span> of the lens and its aperture. Also, once you enter the store to purchase, it costs nothing to start the <span class="n6">camera</span> app and check the brightness of shots and features 
	 yourself.</p></li>
	 
	  <li><h3 class="hh11">Screen size and type:</h3>
	   <img src="How\screen.JPG"class="i11">
	 <p class="p15">There is no doubt that the <span class="n7">size</span> of the <span class="n7">screen</span> will also depend on how you use the <span class="n8">phone</span>, if you are a fan of photography and watching video content,
	 or a fan of games, you should really think about using an Android <span class="n8">phone</span> that has a <span class="n7">screen size</span> of at least <span class="n7">5.7 inches</span> . And for those who mainly use a 
	 <strong>smartphone</strong> for WhatsApp or to browse social media, the smaller <span class="n7">screen</span> will be more than enough.<br>
     As for the <span class="n7">screen type</span>; There are two main types of Android phones: <span class="n7">LCD</span> or <span class="n7">AMOLED</span>. The main difference between the two 
	 lies in the projection of light. In theory, <span class="n7">LCD</span> screens tend to be brighter, <span class="n7">displaying</span> content better when in direct sunlight,
	 while <span class="n7">AMOLED</span> displays provide sharper contrast and more saturated colors.<br>
	 In practice, with the passage of <span class="n8">time</span> and the arrival of new technologies, the difference between the two is becoming less and less clear, yet the
	 resolution of <span class="n7">Full-HD</span>, <span class="n7">FullHD+</span>  or <span class="n7">QHD</span> images is almost impeccable.</p></li></ol>
